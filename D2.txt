Chapter 2, Feature Extraction Methods, covers basic feature extraction methods
from unstructured text. These include tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and
stopword removal. We also discuss observations we might see from these extraction
methods and introduce Zipf's Law. Finally, we discuss the Bag of Words model and
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
